    <h1>Stock Data Analysis Project for an Online Boutique</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the repository for my stock data analysis project for an online boutique. Completed on 06/11/2023, this project highlights the analytical and technical skills I deployed to optimize inventory management through advanced data analyses. By merging various data sources, from ERP exports to specific product characteristics, I delved into the core of inventory management and proposed optimization strategies based on univariate analysis of prices and sales volumes.

        Within this repository, you'll find the Jupyter notebooks containing the Python code used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. I utilized libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. You'll see how statistical methods like outlier identification through Z-score were used to inform decision-making and stock management strategy.

        The goal was to provide clear and actionable insights for the boutique, and I'm excited to share how this analysis can enhance operational efficiency. The detailed presentation of the results is available in this repository, and I hope you will find the information as useful and insightful as the partnering enterprise did.

        I invite you to explore the code, interact with the visualizations, and read my conclusions on the best practices for managing an online store's inventory.
